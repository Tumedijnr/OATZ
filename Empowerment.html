                        <h4> Self Esteem</h4>

							  or judge yourself negatively, you may have low self-esteem.Self-esteem is different to
							  self-confidence. Confidence relates to a person’s ability in a particular area of their
							  life. It is normal to feel confident in some areas and less so in others. </p>
